# DSS-for-optimizing-container-shipping
In this project a logistic provider that is responsible for transporting containers from several multiple deep sea terminals in Rotterdam to one inland terminal is considered. The project concerns a decision support system (DSS) that assists the logistic provider by deciding for each container on which day and via which mode of transportation it is shipped.
